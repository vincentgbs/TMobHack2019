How can we improve a customer's experience and also improve staffing efficiency at T-mobile stores?
1. From a customer POV because T-Mobile puts customers first!
People care about privacy. With all the recent negative publicity for tech companies like Facebook tracking, we don't want to track customers without their knowledge. So we have them opt in but offering to put them in line when they're a certain distance away. This improves their experience by shortening their wait and uses the publics' preferred method of customers opting-in to location tracking.
2. A retail expert estimated off the top of his head that 98-99% of customers walk in rather than scheduling ahead of time. He also said that the customers that do schedule ahead of time often cancel or arrive late. This is a huge inefficiency for staffing.
3. By tracking where a customer really is, we are able to improve staffing. For example: With the previous system, if a customer scheduled a 3:00 appointment, but actually showed up at 3:15, a staff member might be waiting for 15 minutes. With our system, store staff would know how far the customer actually is, and could handle other issues while still keeping the customer's wait time to a minimum when they actually arrive.
4. By making it easy for customers to schedule an appointment, it would decrease the percentage of walk-ins. This would increase the efficiency of the system.
